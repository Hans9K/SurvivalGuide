# Volunteer

### We _need_ you to volunteer!

Very simple, there's no-one employed, every participant, also the organizers pay for their ticket. We're in this boat together and we can make it conquer the seas or crash into a big ice cube.  It's really up to us. 

So we need you to lend a hand. Please consider volunteering at least 5 hours. If we do the math this should be the average amount everyone should volunteer. Please take into account that most shifts don't require constant work. For example a kitchen shift is usually counted at 3 hours, but most of it is 'being there'. 

**The good shifts are gone the fastest, please sign up here:** [**https://angels.roguerope.be/**](https://angels.roguerope.be/)\*\*\*\*

You are free to sign up for any role, but not for dungeon master/misstress. Since we consider this a big responsibility we need to do some vetting first: please write us a mail with your background or skills in the area. Or if you haven't got experience, tell us why you'd be a good candidate.
