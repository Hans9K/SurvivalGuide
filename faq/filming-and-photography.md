# Filming and Photography

## [For all of us](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

Always get consent before you film or photograph someone at Nowhere. Never film or photograph someone without their express consent.

Nowhere is a special place, where people are encouraged to express themselves in a variety of colourful ways. It is a ready feast for the eyes, and the camera.  
– You have the right to ask someone to stop taking a picture/video of you or recording your voice.  
– You have the right to know what someone plans to do with a photo/video/audio recording.

In the event that you have a dispute with someone about photography, please flag down a Nomad or come to Malfare so that the volunteers there can help to mediate the situation. Your right to take someone’s photo and publish it **NEVER** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto Facebook or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission

Nowhere is a private event and all rights regarding imagery, sound, or art are reserved by the event organization. Use of any image or sound recorded at Nowhere, be it digital, analog or still camera equipment, is subject to written permission from Nowhere. All written permissions will be limited to the particular project described, and may be subject to restrictions. Specifically, no photo, video, audio or other media taken at Nowhere can be used for commercial purposes.

If you have any questions about photography or filming at Nowhere, please email [media@goingnowhere.org](mailto:media@goingnowhere.org)

## [For non-professionals](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

Lots of people bring cameras to Nowhere. It’s a unique and visually stimulating experience, and it’s natural to want to record it. Please be respectful when taking photos, ask permission, and be aware that the beauty and freedom of Nowhere may feel very different when plastered across Facebook to be witnessed by your mum and boss.

If you’re taking photos for your own use, please respect each other and our community.
