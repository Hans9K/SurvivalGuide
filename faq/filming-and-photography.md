# Filming and Photography

## For all of us

Always get consent before you film or photograph someone at Rope Camp.

**Never film or photograph someone without their express consent.** This includes people in the background of a photo you're taking.

In the event that you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the organizer know. Your right to take someoneâ€™s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto Fetlife or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission

If you have any questions about photography or filming at Rope Camp, please email [support@roguerope.be](mailto:support@roguerope.be)

## DRONES. Can I fly my drone at Rope Camp?

Yes, but respect relevant laws and be cool.
