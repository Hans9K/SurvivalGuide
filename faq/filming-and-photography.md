# Filming and Photography

## For all of us

Always get consent before you film or photograph someone at Rope Camp. Never film or photograph someone without their express consent.

Rope Camp is a special place, where people are encouraged to express themselves in a variety of colourful ways. It is a ready feast for the eyes, and the camera.  
– You have the right to ask someone to stop taking a picture/video of you or recording your voice.  
– You have the right to know what someone plans to do with a photo/video/audio recording.

In the event that you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the orga know. Your right to take someone’s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto Fet or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission

If you have any questions about photography or filming at Rope Camp, please email [support@roguerope.be](mailto:support@roguerope.be)

## For non-professionals

Lots of people bring cameras to Rope Camp. It’s a unique and visually stimulating experience, and it’s natural to want to record it. Please be respectful when taking photos, ask permission, and be aware that the beauty and freedom of Rope Camp may feel very different when plastered across Facebook to be witnessed by your mum and boss.

If you’re taking photos for your own use, please respect each other and our community.
