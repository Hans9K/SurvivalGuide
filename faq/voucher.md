# Vouchers

The amount of participants is limited, this is because of the site and because of the covid guidelines. The assumption is that demand will be much bigger than the supply. 

There are 2 ways to handle this: 
* The Tommorowland way: open ticket sales at a certain time and hope for the best. Tickets sales will essentially become a lottery. 
* The meritocratic way: people who've participated before and made a positive contribution will have the opportunity to buy a presale-ticket first. 

## How will this work?
A 'voucher' is an unique code that you can use to buy a ticket.

Sadly, our assumption is that it will be fully booked, when this pre-sale is over. We were almost fully booked last year, and we give all participants a voucher. Also the people that came as a single last year, will receive two vouchers.

Looking forward to next year, the plan is to double the available capacity, so more new people will have a chance to sign up.
