# Participation

#### [I’d like to help out, but honestly, I have no skills. What can I do?](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

At Nowhere, we’re all volunteers, and we always need more help! Two thirds of Nowhere participants volunteer in some capacity during, before or after the event. Skills are less important than a can-do attitude and the willingness to work hard. You could come early and help set up, or stay late and help clear up. See [volunteer positions](https://www.goingnowhere.org/get-involved/volunteering/#rolestobefilled) for the roles we’re recruiting for now or email [volunteer@goingnowhere.org](mailto:volunteer@goingnowhere.org) to offer more general help.

#### [Can I make art?](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

Damn right! Nowhere is, among other things, an arts event, and we encourage participants to create and contribute art. See the [art page](https://www.goingnowhere.org/get-involved/art/) for more information.

#### [But I can’t build stuff or make art! What can I do?](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

Contribute in any way you can. You could cook for your camp, give manicures, massages, presents or performances, and anything else that takes your fancy! Everyone has a valuable contribution to make – [here are some more ideas.](https://www.goingnowhere.org/get-involved/volunteering/)
