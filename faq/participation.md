# Participation

## I’d like to help out, but honestly, I have no skills. What can I do?

At Rope Camp, we’re all volunteers, and we always need more help! Two thirds of Rope Camp participants volunteer in some capacity during, before or after the event. Skills are less important than a can-do attitude and the willingness to work hard. You could come early and help set up, or stay late and help clear up. See [volunteer positions](https://angels.ropecamp.be) for the roles we’re recruiting for now or email [volunteer@support@ropecamp.be](mailto:support@ropecamp.be) to offer more general help.

## Can I make art?

Damn right! Rope Camp is, among other things, an arts event, and we encourage participants to create and contribute art.

## But I can’t build stuff or make art! What can I do?

Contribute in any way you can. You could cook for your camp, give manicures, massages, presents or performances, and anything else that takes your fancy! Everyone has a valuable contribution to make – [here are some more ideas.](https://angels.ropecamp.be)
