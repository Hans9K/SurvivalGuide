# Leave No Shit

#### [What's MOOP?](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

Everything you bring to the desert has the potential to become **MATTER OUT OF PLACE \(MOOP\)**: costumes, water bottles, booze containers, inflatable chairs, hats, fruit, cigarette butts, rope fibres, even sequins can all become MOOP. Every person and every barrio is responsible for their rubbish.

#### [What should I do with my rubbish?](https://www.goingnowhere.org/faq/)

One of the fundamental idea of Leave no trace is : **Pack it in, pack it out**. Everything brought at Nowhere will have to be taken away before the end of the event.

However, at Nowhere, the WaR Zone is a designated site where volunteers can help you dispose of rubbish and recycle. This is to be used with care and respect and is only open during the day.

Large items such as mattresses, tents, building materials etc. will NOT be accepted at the WaR Zone and must be taken home with you.

#### **NEVER LET MOOP HIT THE GROUND. Clean As You Go. MOOP Attracts More MOOP. When You See Trash On The Ground, Pick It Up And Take It With You – You Won’t See It Later As Layers Of Dust Accumulate**

* **Carry a MOOP bag**. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find. You can, of course, customise your MOOP bag to make it a part of your playa wear.
* **Weigh items down/don’t let them blow away**: put a weight on or tie down anything that can blow away.
* If you’re a smoker, **carry a portable ashtray** such as a mint tin with you at all times. Or put butts in your pocket. **Never, ever drop butts**.
* **Ask permission before using a barrio’s refuse area if you are not camping with them**. Some barrios will only be able to deal with their own campers’ rubbish.
* Only biodegradable food waste and absorbent paper \(e.g. kitchen roll\) should be put in the organic recycling
* **Separate recycling** into glass, plastic, aluminium and cardboard/paper.
* Do not let bins overflow and MOOP get out of hand.
* **NEVER burn rubbish!** Take it to the waste disposal site or into the containers located in Sariñena.
* If in doubt, ask your barrio LNT Lead. Freecampers can ask Q’s to the Site LNT Lead or [lnt@goingnowhere.org](mailto:lnt@goingnowhere.org) pre-event.
