# Food

Expect basic "camp food". Dishes we can make in large quantities without breaking the bank. There should be enough for everybody. 

We provide vegetarian and meat options, anything beyond that is not within the current capabilities of the kitchen. You are asked to make this choice when you sign up for a ticket, people that signed up as meat-eater are not allowed to eat the veggie stuff if it looks better.
