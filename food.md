# Food

Expect basic "camp food": dishes we can make in large quantities without breaking the bank. There should be enough for everybody.

We provide **vegetarian** and **meat** options, anything beyond that is not within the current capabilities of the kitchen. 
You are asked to make this choice when you sign up for a ticket. Note that people who've signed up as meat-eater are not allowed to eat the veggie stuff if it looks better.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event. If you have very specific nutrition needs (vegan, gluten-free,organic), I'm very sorry but this event does not have the human resources or capabilities to cater to you.

We will also provide coffee, tea, sparkling and still water free of charge for all participants.

**At the bar:** For a small price, we will provide different beers, wine and soda's, ice creams, croque-monsieur, chips...

If you want to help shaping the cooking crew or menu, let us know on support@roguerope.be.

We will buy enough to provide for all participants, we will expect there will be left, and hope all participants take some home as to not waste food.
