# Food

Expect basic "camp food". Dishes we can make in large quantities without breaking the bank. There should be enough for everybody.

We provide **vegetarian** and **meat** options, anything beyond that is not within the current capabilities of the kitchen. 
You are asked to make this choice when you sign up for a ticket, people that signed up as meat-eater are not allowed to eat the veggie stuff if it looks better.

|*Time* | --     | Thu     | Fri            | Sat          | Sun       |

| 19-21 | Dinner | Hot-dogs| Spaghetti      | BBQ          | --/--     |

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, if you're part of the *vegan/organic/gluten-free quinoa-crowd*, this event is *not* for you.

We will also provide coffee, tea, sparkling and still water free of charge for all participants.

**At the bar:** For a small cost, we will provide different beers and soda's, ice creams, croques, chips...

If you want to help shaping the cooking crew or menu, let us know on support@roguerope.be.
