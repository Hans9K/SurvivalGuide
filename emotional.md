# Emotional

Things will get chaotic at Rope Camp. For example, interacting might feel too intense at times, and/or you may feel a bit alone or alienated, without familiar comforts to rely on. But there are plenty of ways to deal with this! 

Here are some tips : 

* Be gentle with your body 
* Seek help if you need it 
* State your boundaries and communicate, whether talking with strangers or your loved ones 
* Have the experience that makes YOU happy 
* Connect in ways that make YOU comfortable 

### Couples

Spend all the time together you want, but leave room for yourself and your own interests, too. Remember that there are many of new friends for you each to meet as well, so each of you should feel encouraged to spend time with other people as well as each other. Still, be sure to schedule plenty of ‘dates’ together, and keep them. Just make sure that you honor your time together, but also apart.
