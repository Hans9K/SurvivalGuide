# Cancellation

## Corona Cancellation

Let's start by addressing the very small elephant in the room: if the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws, the event shall not take place. Furthermore, in this case, everyone will receive a **full refunds** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers\) there are no hidden fees deducted. If you paid X euro's, we'll send you your X euro's back via bank transfer.

**UPDATE:** good news, rope camp, with a capacity of up to 50 ppl. is also completely legal within Covid limits. All systems go! 

[Source](https://www.belgium.be/nl/corona): 'Sportieve en nu ook culturele activiteiten die worden georganiseerd en begeleid door een verantwoordelijke zijn beperkt tot 20 personen in juni en **50 personen in juli**, met inachtneming van de veiligheidsafstanden.'

**So no risks there.**

## Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know so we can update the list of participants.

## Early termination of the event.

The amount of the ticket is non-refundable if the Event has started but is terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature or other conditions beyond our control.
