# Cancellation

### Corona Cancellation

Let's start by addressing the vvery small elephant in the room: if the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws, the event shall not take place. Furthermore, in this case, everyone will receive a **full refunds** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers, t-shirts\) there are no hidden fees deducted. If you paid 200 euro's, we'll send you your 200 euro's back via bank transfer. 

**So no risks there.** 

### Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know so we can update the list of participants.

### Early termination of the event.

The amount of the ticket is non-refundable if the Event has started but is terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature, governmental regulation or other conditions beyond our control.
