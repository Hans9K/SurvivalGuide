# What's this rope camp?

Since there wasn't anything happning during the lockdown and the foresight of a completely event-less summer scared me, I decided to set up this camp. 

Added by the fact that the C-thing prevented me of getting any form of Rogue Rope events going. The 'organizer' in me started to have a little itch. Fueled with the isolation of being at home, and a freshly installed computer I developed the idea, found a location and have set up a basic infrastructure so far. 

This includes: 

* [Statutes](https://hackmd.io/@vBpP7blkRQKVuNfmuK-qPg/rJYjip4uL) for a non-profit.
* A event ticket selling [platform](https://camp.roguerope.be/).
* A [volunteer shift system](https://angels.roguerope.be/). 
* A [ticket system](https://help.roguerope.be/) that also integrates with email \(support@roguerope.be\).

There is a basic menu:      

| X | Don | Vrij | Zat | Zon |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Brunch | Niets | Ontbijt | Ontbijt | Ontbijt |
| Soep | Niets | Groentensoep - humus , brood | Tomatensoep olijven, tapas | Niets / Leftovers |
| Avond | Hot-dogs, agurken,  warme ajuin, warme zuurkool, saus, kaas. | Spagetti Veggy / Bolognaise | BBQ | Niets |

The setup is volunteer driven, **everyone needs to participate.**
