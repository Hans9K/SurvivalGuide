# What's this rope camp?

Since there wasn't anything happning during the lockdown and the foresight of a completely event-less summer scared me, I decided to set up this camp.

Added by the fact that the C-thing prevented me of getting any form of Rogue Rope events going. The 'organizer' in me started to have a little itch. Fueled with the isolation of being at home, and a freshly installed computer I developed the idea, found a location and planned the basic infrastructure so far.

The setup is volunteer driven, **everyone needs to participate.**
