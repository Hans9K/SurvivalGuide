  exactly 10 principles, smells like religion. So we have N principles, N is

# The N Principles of Rogue Rope

### Radical Transparency <a id="Radical-Transparancy"></a>

Any part of the orga will be open for the participants. There’s no secret man behind the curtain. Financial en organisational stuff should be clear to all interested participants. For external people, We'll probably be judged by them. So fuck it, we’re a yoga club.

### Radical Self-responsibility <a id="Radical-Self-responsibility"></a>

Rogue Rope encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources. We don’t care about your hangups, or politics.  
You’re mental state is also your responsibility you are what you are, and what you take.

### Remix Culture <a id="Remix-Culture"></a>

Everything is should free and open. if you don’t want something copied, adapted an redistributed. Shut your pie-hole and keep it to yourself. We don’t believe in the combination of ‘intellectual’ and ‘property’. Knowledge wants to be free.

### Communal Effort <a id="Communal-Effort"></a>

Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.

### Yes, you can! <a id="Yes-you-can"></a>

We value constructive anarchy. We believe in doing rather than talking. Don’t ask, just do. If you fuck up, be sure to be able to reverse the crap you did to the state it was before.

### Leave No Shit <a id="Leave-No-Shit"></a>

If you use or borrow something, return it in a better state than when you received it.  
We are committed not to stuff the orga with huge cleaning costs or efforts. The orga isn’t our mum.

### Creative Capitalism <a id="Creative-Capitalism"></a>

Money is not the root of all evil but keeps things afloat.   
Cool people aren’t profit motivated, boring people are, don’t be boring.

### Consent: ask before you fondle. <a id="Consent-ask-before-you-fondle"></a>

We want to create a setting where all parties participate in a physical encounter from a place of enthusiasm and autonomy. We believe a yes is yes, even when said while intoxicated. We believe an act is an act even when done while intoxicated.
