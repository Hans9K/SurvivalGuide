  Didn’t want to have  exactly 10 principles, smells like religion. So we have N principles, N is
  variable, could be more, could be less. Could change, might as well stay the same.

# The N Principles of Rogue Rope

## Radical Self-responsibility <a id="Radical-Self-responsibility"></a>

Rogue Rope encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources. We don’t care about your hangups, or politics.  
You’re mental state is also your responsibility you are what/who you are, and what you take.

## Remix Culture <a id="Remix-Culture"></a>

Everything is should free and open. if you don’t want something copied, adapted an redistributed. Shut your pie-hole and keep it to yourself. We don’t believe in the combination of ‘intellectual’ and ‘property’. Knowledge wants to be free.

## Communal Effort <a id="Communal-Effort"></a>

Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration above competition and greed.

## Yes, you can! <a id="Yes-you-can"></a>

We value constructive anarchy. We believe in doing rather than talking. Don’t ask, just do. If you fuck up, be sure to be able to reverse the crap you did to the state it was before.

## Leave No Shit <a id="Leave-No-Shit"></a>

If you use or borrow something, return it in a better state than when you received it.  
We are committed not to stuff the organizer with huge cleaning costs or efforts. The organizer isn’t our mum.

## Creative Capitalism <a id="Creative-Capitalism"></a>

Money is not the root of all evil but keeps people alive and planes in the air. Money is also the stuff the enables corruption *and* Greenpeace. Money is a way of keeping score, money is debt. Money is morally neutral. 
Cool people aren’t profit motivated, boring people are, _don’t be boring_.

## Consent: ask before you fondle. <a id="Consent-ask-before-you-fondle"></a>

We want to create a setting where all parties participate in a physical encounter from a place of enthusiasm and autonomy. We believe a yes is yes.
