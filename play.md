# Play
## Rope play 
Traditionally we welcome rope play of *any* level. There's this misconception that you have to be good with ropes to partake with RR. 
We don't know how this started, but want to stress this is _not_ the case. Everyone is welcome, everyone that wants info should feel free to approach us. 
If you want to try new stuff and have someone spot you, that's fine as well. 

Everybody started from zero, and we're always interested in learning to know new people. 

## Other play
* Other play is welcome: wips, canes, chains, ductape, blood, fire. 
* We're not afraid of nudity or sex, the plan is to improvise a dark room as well.
* Golden showers and scat are hard to do in a 'clean' way at the camp, so we'll need to draw the line there.
