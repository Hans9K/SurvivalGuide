# Performances

## description: 'Friday : we'll have an open stage.'

Maybe we can do some performances on Friday, doesn't have to be rope.  
Maybe you do spoken word, or can give a dance demo, maybe you can pull a bunny out of your hat instead of suspending it to the ceiling?

Share your skill and surprise us.

_All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players._
