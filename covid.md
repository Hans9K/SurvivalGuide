# COVID

We're following the situation day-by-day. It's very frustrating to see the infections rise again. We don't have a crystal ball so it's hard to forecast what will happen. We do see a trend shifitng from a one-size-fits-all solution in Belgium to shifting more repsonsibility in direction of the municipalties. The good news is: Vielsalm is a community with [0 cases of Corona](https://datastudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/c14a5cfc-cab7-4812-848c-0369173148ab/page/giyUB).


## Protocols 

We're following 2 protocols:

First one is the protocol for events. These where tightened 26/7, lowering the capacity to 100 people inside and 200 outside, which is well beyond our capacity of 49. We did the [official event scan](https://www.covideventriskmodel.be/) and we got a green label.

The second protocol, is related to sport stages. We define Shibari/Bondage as a type of bodily exercise. In sport, bubbles are defined as 50 people. Here we follow the [current guidelines for sport](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/corona-en-sportbeoefening-in-vlaanderen/).

This also means we follow the [Protocol for sportstages](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/media/13719/protocol-voor-sportkampenvolsen.pdf) for adults and seniors as defined by Sport Flanders.

## Some of the Covid changes
* Move everything outside
* There's no more buffet, you will go to a counter choose what you want, and take this outside.
* The 2 shower rooms will only be used one bubble at the time.

## Some basic tips/rules/measures:

We'll take our own precautions, here's to hoping for good weather so we can use the outside space as much as we can.


* **Always** have your mask _with_ you, we will provide some masks for you if you forgot. Maybe some situation will arise where the org decides it's strictly necessary and you will be asked to put it on. If such a situation should arise, you should be able to put it on.
* Respect people's boundaries, we'll take the 1.5 meteuir rule as a guideline, if you want to deviate from that, you ask the persons involved. This also implies keeping distance when queng for stuff.
* We will take temps of all visitors, but this does unfortunately **not** mean everyone is healthy and we can go lie in a big pike exchanging fluids. Asymptomatic people can still transmit. 
* Furthermore we've taken different steps to lower chances of infection. 
* We do take things seriously, **we're not having an illicit zero-fucks-given party in the woods**, but a legit, small scale, corona-proof event.
* We've asked you to bring a mug, now we also urge you to bring your own personal knife, fork and spoon. 
* If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the orga people. 

## In case of symptoms: stay home!

* Checklist [dutch](https://www.horeca.com/nl/corona) / [English](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)
* **NEW:** _**Ticket refund**_**.** If you have a doctors advice telling you to quarantine, **ask to get it in writing**, forward this to the org and we'll refund the ticket of you _and_ your partner. It's the least we can do.
