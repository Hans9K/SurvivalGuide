Becoming a super camp participant is a fairly straight forward process:

{% hint style="success" %}
Go to [https://camp.roguerope.be](https://camp.roguerope.be) and buy a ticket, we take Bancontact and Mollie, and we send the tickets to your doorstep free of charge. If for reasons of corona the vent is canceled you will receive 100% of your money back.

### Sign up for some shifts

We need you to make this work, please share your time to make this great.

{% hint style="warning" %}

### Stay safe.

Nothing much more to do than to take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
1. Stay at home, especially if you are sick.
2. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water.
3. Keep enough distance \(1.5 metres\) when outdoors.
4. Watch out for those most at risk.
{% endhint %}

### Get at the location

The site is near Vielsalm, you can get there by car, but there's also a train station 2.5km away. 

{% hint style="success" %}
We'll setup a whatsapp group for driving to the station and back.
{% endhint %}

### Give your ticket to the greeter.

You made it! Make sure to bring your ticket, you will get a [release statement](release-statement..md) to sign.
Newt we will measure your body temp, if it's above 37.2 C you will be asked to leave.
If it's lower you will get a nice bracelet in return to prove you are now one of the cool healthy kids.


{% hint style="success" %}
Now it's time to relax, set up your tent and come to share a drink with us.
