Nothing much more to do than to take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

## Get at the location

The site is near Vielsalm, you can get there by car, but there's also a train station 2.5km away.

{% hint style="success" %}
We'll setup a whatsapp group and a car pooling sheet for driving to the site and back.

## Give your order number to the greeter.

You made it! Make sure to bring your order number, so we can verify payment, you will get a [release statement](release-statement.md) to sign.   
Next we will measure your body temp, if it's above 37.2 C you will be asked to leave. If it's lower you will get a nice bracelet in return to prove you are now one of the cool healthy kids.

{% hint style="success" %}
Now it's time to relax, set up your tent and come to share a drink with us.
