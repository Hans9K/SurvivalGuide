You made it! Make sure to bring your order confirmation with the qr-code, so we can verify payment, you will get a release statement to sign.

Next we will measure your body temp, if it's above 37.2 C you will be asked to leave, no refunds.

If it's lower you will get a nice bracelet in return to prove you are now one of the cool healthy kids.
